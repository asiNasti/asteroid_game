# ðŸš€ Asteroid Game: The Classic Arcade Shooter
## ðŸŒŒ Overview
The Asteroid Game is a classic arcade-style 2D space shooter built as a learning artifact, likely stemming from the principles taught in the Boot.dev curriculum. The objective is to pilot a small spaceship, navigate a field of dangerous, randomly moving asteroids, and destroy them using lasers before they collide with the ship.

This project focuses on fundamental game development concepts, including:

- Game Loop Implementation: Managing update and render cycles for smooth animation

- Object Physics: Handling velocity, rotation, and boundary conditions for the player and asteroids

- Collision Detection: Implementing algorithms to detect hits between the player, lasers, and asteroids

- State Management: Tracking score, lives, and game states (e.g., Playing, Game Over)

## Core Gameplay
- Objective: Destroy all asteroids to clear the current level and advance

- Asteroids: Asteroids move randomly. When a large asteroid is hit, it breaks into two smaller, faster pieces

- Scoring: Points are awarded based on the size of the asteroid destroyed (smaller pieces yield more points)

- Hazards: Losing a life occurs upon collision with an asteroid. The game ends when all lives are lost
